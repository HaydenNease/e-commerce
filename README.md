Application is live at https://haydennease.github.io/e-commerce/  
## Description
I created this application to store and modify a collection of inventory items on a server. This could potentially be accessed by anyone and sorted by categories or  tags.

## Installation
A terminal is required to host the server on your local machine and Insomnia is used to process the HTTP methods. A script is included to start the server with nodemon, but it is not required to run the application.

## Usage
Entering `npm run setup` will start the installation process, seed the provided data, and launch the server on your local machine. Once that is done, Insomnia can process the methods by entering the necessary paths.
